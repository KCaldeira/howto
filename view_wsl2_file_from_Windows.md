# Opening CSV, pdf, files in a WSL 2 file system using Windows default applications
If you want to open a CSV file in **Excel** (installed on Windows) directly from your WSL 2 terminal:

```bash
explorer.exe mydata.csv
```

This uses Windows' default program for `.csv` files (often Excel).  
- If Excel is your default app, it will open there.  
- If not, it will open in whatever CSV viewer is default.  

**Tip:** You can also move or copy the file into your Windows filesystem and open it manually. For example:

```bash
cp mydata.csv /mnt/c/Users/<YourWindowsUser>/Documents/
